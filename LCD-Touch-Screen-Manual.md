## Measures

![](assets/026_calibration.png)

This panel gives you access to tools to help you adjust some parameters of your printer.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Some parameters are directly derived from the mechanical parts of the printer. Unless you change these parts (like the step motors), there is no need to change them.

* **Level**: Tool to help you level your bed.
* **Extruder**: Tool to help you adjust the number of steps per millimeter for the extruder motor.
* **XYZ motors**: Tool to help you adjust the number of steps per millimeter for X and Y motors.
* **PID tuning**: Tool to help you adjust the PID parameters ([proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm](http://reprap.org/wiki/PID_Tuning)).

## Level

This tool helps you level your bed.

* First, the head and bed return to their home position.

![](assets/046_level_1.png)

* Then, press one of the button with a number to go to each position:

![](assets/048_level_2.png)

* Adjust each thumb nut so a feeler gauge (0.1 mm) can move between the nozzle and the bed with just a tiny bit of friction:

![](assets/leveling.jpg)

* If you do not have a feeler gauge, you can also use a sheet of paper but it is less accurate.

* Press the 5th button to check that your leveling is good. Press any of the other button to level again the corresponding corner.

* Once you are satisfied with the leveling, press the **Back** button.

**üí° Tip**: *A feeler gauge are cheap and you can buy one for a few dollars on Amazon, Banggood, etc. For example (randomly chosen items)*:

## Extruder

This tool helps you adjust adjust the number of steps per millimeter for the extruder motor. There is no need to do this more than once, except if you change some mechanical parts.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: *This parameter (number of steps per millimeter) is directly derived from the mechanical parts of the printer (the step motor, the gear, ...) Unless you change these parts (like the gear), there is no need to change this parameter. Its default value is `400.5`.*

![](assets/050_extruder_1.png)

* Measures 120 mm of filament above the extruder and set, with a pen, a mark on the filament:

![](assets/Extruder1.jpg)

* Select the extruder's target temperature you want to use (with the plus and minus buttons) and press the arrow button (top-right corner). 

**üí° Tip**: *Keep the button pressed to quickly increment or decrement the temperature.*

* The printer starts heating the hot-end and when the target temperature is reached, it extrudes 100 mm of filament.

* Once the extrusion is finished (it takes around a minute), measures the filament remaining between the extruder and your mark:

![](assets/Extruder2.jpg)

* Enter the value in mm:

![](assets/054_extruder_3.png)

**üí° Tip**: *Keep the button pressed to quickly increment or decrement the value.*

* The computed value (E) is displayed and you can adjust it manually if you want:

![](assets/072_steps_settings.png)

* Press the **Back** button the restart the process, or on the **Checkmark** button to save the settings. They are saved in the EEPROM memory of the motherboard.

## XYZ motors

This tool helps you adjust adjust the number of steps per millimeter for the X, Y and Z motors. There is no need to do this more than once, except if you change some mechanical parts.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: *These parameters (number of steps per millimeter) are directly derived from the mechanical parts of the printer (the step motor, ...) Unless you change these parts (like the motors), there is no need to change this parameter. The default values are `81`, `81`, and `400.5`.*

* Print a cube 20x20x20 mm  and enter it actual dimensions (make more than one measure for each side and take the average):

![](assets/056_motors.png)

* The computed values (X, Y and Z) are displayed and you can adjust them manually if you want:

![](assets/072_steps_settings.png)

* Press the **Back** button the restart the process, or on the **Checkmark** button to save the settings. They are saved in the EEPROM memory of the motherboard.

**üí° Tips**: *There are several calibration cubes on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com). For example:*

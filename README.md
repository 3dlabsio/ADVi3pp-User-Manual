# Introduction

**ADVi3++** is a custom firmware for **Wanaho** Duplicator i3+ printers (and their clones like the Monoprice Select Plus). It is based on the latest stable release of Marlin and adds some new specific features. It has the following features when compared to the stock Wanhao firmwares:

* Based on **Marlin 1.1.8** (stock Wanhao firmwares are based on Marlin 1.1.4)
* New redesigned LCD screens
* Access on the LCD display to more printer parameters like Feedrate, Acceleration and Jerk settings
* Tuning of the X, Y, and Z motors as well as the extruder motor
* Temperature graphs
* 3 preheat presets
* 5 points manual bed leveling
* BLTouch support with automatic bed leveling
* Display of messages (M117 code) from external software such as OctoPrint (Detailed progress plugin for example)
* Advanced Pause (M600 support)
* An up to date User Manual

## Compatibility

Currently, **ADVi3++** is only compatible with the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus version 1 printer and its clones. Version 2 (aka Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus **Mark II**) will be supported in a future release.

**ADVi3++** is not compatible with printers that do not have a similar LCD panel (DGUS DWIN), i.e. it is not compatible with previous versions of Duplicator i3, i3 Mini, etc.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Dylan xKoldx](https://github.com/xKoldx/ADVi3pp-Marlin) and [weidercs](https://github.com/weidercs/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for their forks supporting BLTouch. Thanks to Matt Cowell [SureshotM6](https://github.com/SureshotM6/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for the fork supporting M600 and head parking.

Thanks you to Leo LÃ¼ker (Silverquark) for his [i3plus+ project](https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus). I take many ideas from his code. But the project is no more active and I do not like the screens (personal taste) so I have created the **ADVi3++** fork. It is technically a fork of Marlin, not of i3plus+.

Thanks to [MarlinTeam](http://marlinfw.org/) for their great work.
